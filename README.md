WORDLE

This is a simple command version of the game Wordle.
In this game, a random 5-letter word is selected and you need to guess it. In order to do that, you must enter a 5-letter word, then the game will give information about the individual letters entered:

Lowercase letter: correct letter, wrong position.

Uppercase letter: correct letter, correct position.

_ : incorrect letter.

Would you be able to guess the word in just 5 tries?

In this version, each possible guessable word is stored in the data.txt file linked to the index, so you can either play with a random word or challenge your friends with a predetermined one.
